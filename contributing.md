## What to contribute

- Review code on other people’s submissions and help improving / finding vulnerabilities

## Making a PR
- Provide all the appropriate details asked in PR template
- A pull request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a pull request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.

## Opening an Issue
- Make use of an appropriate Issue Template
- We welcome Feature request, Bug Report, Documentation fix and others
- Do not open critical security issues here, report them directly at [our email](mailto:contact@codechefvit.com).

## Communicating effectively
**Give context.** Help others get quickly up to speed. If you’re running into an error, explain what you’re trying to do and how to reproduce it. If you’re suggesting a new idea, explain why you think it’d be useful to the project (not just to you!).

```
✔️ “X doesn’t happen when I do Y”
❌ “X is broken! Please fix it.”
```

**Do your homework beforehand.** It’s OK not to know things, but show that you tried. Before asking for help, be sure to check a project’s README, documentation, issues (open or closed), mailing list, and search the internet for an answer. People will appreciate when you demonstrate that you’re trying to learn.

```
✔️ ““I’m not sure how to implement X. I checked the help docs and didn’t find any mentions.””
❌ “How do I X?”
```

**Keep requests short and direct.**

```
✔️ “I’d like to write an API tutorial.”
❌ “I was driving down the highway the other day and stopped for gas, and then I had this amazing idea for something we should be doing, but before I explain that, let me show you…“
```

**It’s okay to ask questions (but be patient!).**

```
✔️ “Thanks for looking into this error. I followed your suggestions. Here’s the output.”
❌ “Why can’t you fix my problem? Isn’t this your project?”
```

**Respect community decisions.**

```
✔️ “I’m disappointed you can’t support my use case, but as you’ve explained it only affects a minor portion of users, I understand why. Thanks for listening.”
❌ “Why won’t you support my use case? This is unacceptable!”
```
